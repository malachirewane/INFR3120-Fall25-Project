## 📌 Overview

TaskFlow is a lightweight task management web application designed to help users easily create, view, update, and delete tasks. This first release focuses on core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

The landing page displays the project name, a custom team logo, a button to add tasks, and a table listing existing tasks.

This release represents the foundation for future improvements such as sorting, filtering, authentication, and notifications.
